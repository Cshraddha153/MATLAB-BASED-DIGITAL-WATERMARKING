# MATLAB BASED DIGITAL WATERMARKING (Digital Image Processing LAB Mini Project)

In this project, Digital Watermarking techniques are implemented using MATLAB to enhance image copyright protection. The work focuses on both visible and invisible watermarking.

First, the host and watermark images are loaded, converted to grayscale, and preprocessed.
For visible watermarking, the watermark is blended with the host image using a weighted average method controlled by a transparency factor (alpha).
For invisible watermarking, the watermark is embedded into the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of the host image, making it imperceptible to human eyes.

Later, the invisible watermark is successfully extracted from the watermarked image to demonstrate the effectiveness of the embedding technique.
This project highlights how digital watermarking can be used to protect ownership rights and secure digital media content.
