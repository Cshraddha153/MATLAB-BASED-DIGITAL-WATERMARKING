# MATLAB-BASED-DIGITAL-WATERMARKING
The objective of this project is to embed a hidden watermark (such as a logo, text, or identification mark) into a digital image without significantly affecting its visual quality. The watermark provides ownership protection, copyright verification, and content authentication.
